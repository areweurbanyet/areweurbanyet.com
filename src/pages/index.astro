      Are We Urban Yet? is a project that aims to shed light on efforts to
      reduce car dependency, promote better public transportation, and make it
      easier to get around by walking or cycling in order to help both citizens
      and policymakers alike make informed decisions and help shape cities to be
      what you want.
