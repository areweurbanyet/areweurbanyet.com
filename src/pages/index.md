Are We Urban Yet? is a project that aims to shed light on efforts to reduce car
dependency, promote better public transportation, and make it easier to get
around by walking or cycling in order to help both citizens and policymakers
alike make informed decisions and help shape cities to be what you want.

Right now the project is under construction, and is entirely
volunteer-run. If you want to stay up-to-date with our progress, make
sure to follow us over on [BlueSky][bluesky]! We'll be posting regular updates
on how things are going as well as when new content is released.

We greatly appreciate any support you're willing to give! If you believe in our
mission and want to help us keep the lights on, we're accepting both one-time
and regular donations on [Ko-Fi][ko-fi] as well as sponsorships over on
[GitHub][github-sponsors]. We also appreciate any shout-outs over on BlueSky!

Stay tuned!
